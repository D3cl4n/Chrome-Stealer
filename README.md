# Chrome-Stealer
C++ project to extract cached chrome credentials. Intended to be used as a post exploitation tool for offensive security researchers. Illegal activity is not condoned and I am not responsible for how you use this.

# Notes
To use you have to setup the libraries yourself if you want to build it. Compiled with MinGW, dynamically linked library DLLs are included in the repo as well as the executable. 

# Demo
